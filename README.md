## How to Use

- Create a directory named `ps5_autoloader`.
- Inside this directory, place your `.elf`, `.bin`, and `.jar` files, and an `autoload.txt` file.
  - In `autoload.txt`, list the files you want to load, one filename per line.
  - Filenames are case-sensitive — ensure each name exactly matches the file.
  - You can add lines like `!1000` to make the loader wait 1000 ms before sending the next payload.
  - You can add lines like `@ message` to show a notification on the PS5.
  - Do NOT include `elfldr.elf` in `autoload.txt` unless you want to override the bundled version; it is loaded automatically when needed for ELF/BIN payloads.
- Put the `ps5_autoloader` directory in one of these locations (priority order - highest first):
  - Root of a USB drive
  - Internal drive: `/data/ps5_autoloader`
  - Root of the disc itself.


## Setup Instructions

This autoloader is deployed via a BD-R disc.

1. Download the **PS5 BD-JB Autoloader ISO** from the [Releases](https://github.com/itsPLK/ps5-bdjb-autoloader/releases) page.
2. Burn the ISO to a BD-R(E) disc using software like `ImgBurn` (use UDF 2.50 filesystem).
3. Insert the disc into the PS5 and launch it from the "Media" tab.

*Note: Since this is a disc-based loader, updates to the loader itself require burning a new ISO. However, your payloads on USB or internal storage can be updated at any time.*


## Additional Info

<Details>
<Summary><i>How to use custom ELF Loader version?</i></Summary>

By default, the autoloader uses a custom version of **elfldr** that only accepts connections from the PS5 itself (localhost). This improves security by preventing other devices on your network from sending payloads to your console.

If you want to use a "normal" ELF Loader that allows sending payloads from any device:
1. Place your custom ELF Loader (e.g. `elfldr.elf`) in the `ps5_autoloader` directory.
2. Add `elfldr.elf` to your `autoload.txt`.
3. **Note**: If you are loading other payloads right after `elfldr.elf` in your `autoload.txt`, add a sleep command immediately after it (like `!4000` to sleep for 4 seconds) to give the new ELF Loader time to start up and listen before subsequent payloads are sent.

Example `autoload.txt`:
```text
# Load custom ELF Loader
elfldr.elf
# Give it 4 seconds to start up (only needed if sending more payloads)
!4000
# Send other payloads
ftpsrv.elf
```

<Summary><i>etaHEN loading stability issues</i></Summary>
Sometimes etaHEN will fail to load. It seems that etaHEN/kstuff often won't finish loading until the Disc Player app is closed.

**Recommended Solution:**  
In default configuration, the autoloader includes Payload Manager. Using it is the most reliable way to load etaHEN/kstuff, as it waits for the Disc Player app to close before loading the payloads. To use it, make pldmgr.elf the only item in your autoload.txt.
